# Doa Jawsyan Kabir: A Supplication of Protection and Blessings
 
Doa Jawsyan Kabir is one of the most beautiful and comprehensive supplications in Islam. It is attributed to Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (as), the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad (saw). The supplication consists of 100 sections, each containing 10 names or attributes of Allah (swt), the Almighty. The supplication is also known as Jawshan al-Kabir, which means "the Great Armor" or "the Great Shield". It is a source of protection, blessings, forgiveness, guidance, and mercy for the believers.
