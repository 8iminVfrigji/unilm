Quality assurance can benefit both the producer and the consumer of the product or service. For the producer, quality assurance can help to reduce costs, improve efficiency, enhance reputation, and gain competitive advantage. For the consumer, quality assurance can help to ensure safety, functionality, usability, and reliability of the product or service.

One of the examples of quality assurance in electronics is the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) certification. The IEC is a global organization that develops and publishes standards for electrical, electronic, and related technologies. The IEC certification indicates that a product or service conforms to the relevant IEC standards and has been tested by an independent and accredited laboratory.
 
Another example of quality assurance in electronics is the Samsung Quality Assurance Lab (SQAL). The SQAL is a network of laboratories that Samsung operates in various regions, such as Korea, China, India, Brazil, and the UK. The SQAL tests and certifies Samsung products for various aspects, such as performance, durability, safety, and compatibility. The SQAL also provides feedback and suggestions to Samsung's research and development teams to improve the quality of Samsung products.
 
A third example of quality assurance in electronics is the ISO 9001 standard. The ISO 9001 is a quality management system standard that specifies the requirements for an organization to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and regulatory requirements. The ISO 9001 standard covers various aspects of quality management, such as leadership, planning, support, operation, performance evaluation, and improvement.
