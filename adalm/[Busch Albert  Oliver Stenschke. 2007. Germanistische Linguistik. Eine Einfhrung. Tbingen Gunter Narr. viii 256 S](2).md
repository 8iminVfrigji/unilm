The book consists of 16 chapters that are organized into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts and terminology of linguistics, such as phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse analysis. Part II deals with the historical development and variation of German, including its origins, dialects, standardization, and contact with other languages. Part III focuses on the social and communicative aspects of German, such as sociolinguistics, language change, language policy, language acquisition, and multilingualism. Part IV explores the applications and implications of linguistics for teaching and learning German, such as language testing, error analysis, corpus linguistics, and lexicography.
 
Germanistische Linguistik is a comprehensive and accessible introduction to German linguistics that combines theoretical insights with practical examples and exercises. It is suitable for both beginners and advanced learners who want to deepen their knowledge and understanding of the German language. The book is available as a PDF file that can be downloaded from the publisher's website.
  
One of the strengths of Germanistische Linguistik is that it adopts a contrastive and comparative approach to German linguistics. It compares German with other languages, especially English, to highlight the similarities and differences between them. It also illustrates how linguistic phenomena can vary across different varieties and registers of German, such as formal and informal speech, written and spoken language, and regional and national varieties. This way, the book helps readers to develop a better awareness and appreciation of the diversity and complexity of the German language.
 
Another strength of Germanistische Linguistik is that it provides a balanced and updated overview of the current state of research and debate in German linguistics. It presents the main theories and models that have shaped the field, as well as the recent trends and challenges that have emerged in the 21st century. It also discusses the relevant issues and controversies that have sparked discussions and controversies among linguists, such as the status and future of standard German, the influence of English on German, and the role of gender and politeness in language use. The book encourages readers to critically evaluate and reflect on the linguistic facts and arguments that are presented.
