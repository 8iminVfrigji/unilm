What is 3D System Shader Model 2.0 and why do you need it? Shader models are versions of DirectX that allow graphics cards to render complex effects and lighting in games. DirectX is a set of APIs that enable developers to create games for Windows and Xbox. Shader Model 2.0 was introduced with DirectX 9.0 and supports more advanced features than Shader Model 1.x.
 
If your computer does not have Shader Model 2.0 or higher, you will not be able to play Farming Simulator 2011 or other games that require it. To check your DirectX version and shader model, you can use a simple diagnostic tool called dxdiag. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Press Win+R and type dxdiag in the box, then press Enter.
2. In the System tab, look for the DirectX Version under the System Information heading.
3. Match your DirectX version with the shader model listed below:

- DirectX 8.0 - Shader Model 1.0 & 1.1
- DirectX 8.0a - Shader Model 1.3
- DirectX 8.1 - Shader Model 1.4
- DirectX 9.0 - Shader Model 2.0
- DirectX 9.0a - Shader Model 2.0a
- DirectX 9.0b - Shader Model 2.0b
- DirectX 9.0c - Shader Model 3.0
- DirectX 10.0\* - Shader Model 4.0
- DirectX 10.1\* - Shader Model 4.1
- DirectX 11.0â  - Shader Model 5.0
- DirectX 11.1â  - Shader Model 5.0
- DirectX 11.2â¡ - Shader Model 5.0
- DirectX 12\*\* - Shader Model 5.1

If your DirectX version is lower than 9.0, you will need to download and install a newer version of DirectX that supports Shader Model 2.0 or higher.
 
You can download DirectX from Microsoft's official website: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)
 
Follow the instructions on the website to install DirectX on your computer.
 
After installing DirectX, you should be able to run Farming Simulator 2011 without any problems.
 
If you still have issues with the game, you may need to update your graphics card drivers or check if your graphics card supports Shader Model 2.0 or higher.
