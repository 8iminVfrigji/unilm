Are you a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, the animated series that follows the adventures of Aang, a young boy who can control all four elements? If so, you might be wondering if there will ever be a sequel to the live-action movie adaptation that was released in 2010. The Last Airbender, directed by M. Night Shyamalan, was a critical and commercial flop that disappointed many fans of the original show. However, there is still hope for a second chance at bringing the beloved story to the big screen.
 
Here is everything you need to know about The Last Airbender 2, including its release date, cast, plot, and more.

## Release Date
 
As of now, there is no official confirmation that The Last Airbender 2 is in development. However, there is some good news for fans of the franchise. In January 2022, Netflix announced that it is producing a new live-action movie based on Avatar: The Last Airbender, with the original creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko as executive producers. The movie is expected to start production later this year and will be part of a larger Avatar universe that Netflix is building with other projects.
 
While this new movie is not a direct sequel to The Last Airbender, it might be a reboot that will retell the story of Aang and his friends in a more faithful and respectful way. It might also pave the way for future movies that will adapt the later seasons of the show and its sequel series, The Legend of Korra.
 
## Cast
 
Since The Last Airbender 2 is not officially happening, there is no cast attached to it. However, if it ever does get made, it is unlikely that the original cast from the first movie will return. The Last Airbender was criticized for its whitewashing of the main characters, who are based on Asian and Indigenous cultures in the show. Many fans and critics also felt that the actors did not capture the personalities and emotions of their animated counterparts.
 
The new Netflix movie, on the other hand, has promised to cast actors who are culturally appropriate for their roles. The casting process is still underway, but some fans have suggested names like Jacob Tremblay, Forrest Wheeler, Isabela Merced, and Booboo Stewart as possible candidates for Aang, Sokka, Katara, and Zuko respectively.
 
## Plot
 
The plot of The Last Airbender 2 would depend on whether it follows the continuity of the first movie or reboots it entirely. If it follows the first movie, it would likely adapt the second season of the show, which introduces new characters like Toph Beifong, a blind earthbender who joins Aang's team; Azula, Zuko's sister and a ruthless firebending prodigy; and Iroh, Zuko's uncle and a former general of the Fire Nation. The second season also explores Aang's struggle to master earthbending and his journey to the Northern Water Tribe to learn waterbending.
 
If it reboots the story, it would probably start from the beginning and retell how Aang was frozen in an iceberg for 100 years until he was awakened by Katara and Sokka, two siblings from the Southern Water Tribe. Together, they embark on a quest to stop the Fire Nation from conquering the world and end the Hundred Year War. Along the way, they encounter friends and foes who help or hinder their mission.
