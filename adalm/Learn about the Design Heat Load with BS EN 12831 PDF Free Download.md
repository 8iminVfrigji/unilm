BS EN 12831 covers three methods for calculating the design heat load: a standard method, a simplified method, and a reference design method. The standard method is the most accurate and detailed, but also the most complex and time-consuming. The simplified method is less accurate but faster and easier to apply. The reference design method is based on typical values and assumptions for different types of buildings and climates.
 
If you are looking for a free download of BS EN 12831 PDF, you may be disappointed to find out that it is not available online for free. The official publisher of the standard, the British Standards Institution (BSI), charges a fee for accessing and downloading the document. However, there are some ways to get access to BS EN 12831 PDF without paying a fortune.
 
## Option 1: Buy a copy from BSI
 
The most straightforward way to get BS EN 12831 PDF is to buy a copy from BSI. You can visit their website and search for the standard by its number or title. You will then be able to purchase the document in various formats, including PDF, hardcopy, or online subscription. The price of the PDF version is Â£246.00 as of April 2023.
 
Buying a copy from BSI has some advantages, such as getting the latest and most updated version of the standard, having a legal and official document that you can use for reference or compliance purposes, and supporting the development and maintenance of standards by BSI.
 
## Option 2: Borrow a copy from a library
 
If you don't want to spend money on buying BS EN 12831 PDF, you can try to borrow a copy from a library. Many libraries have access to standards databases or collections that may include BS EN 12831. You can check with your local or university library if they have the standard available for loan or online access.
 
Borrowing a copy from a library has some advantages, such as saving money on buying the document, having access to other related standards or resources that may be useful for your project, and being able to consult with librarians or experts who may have knowledge or experience with BS EN 12831.
 
## Option 3: Download a copy from an unofficial source
 
If you can't find BS EN 12831 PDF in any library or don't want to wait for a loan or delivery, you can try to download a copy from an unofficial source. There are some websites that claim to offer free downloads of standards documents, such as [^1^], [^2^], or [^3^]. However, these websites are not authorized by BSI or any other standards organization, and they may not have the correct or complete version of BS EN 12831.
 
Downloading a copy from an unofficial source has some disadvantages, such as risking downloading malware or viruses that may harm your computer or device, violating intellectual property rights or copyright laws that may result in legal consequences or penalties, and using an outdated or inaccurate document that may lead to errors or failures in your project.
