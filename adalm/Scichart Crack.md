In this section, we will show you how to use SciChart to create a simple line chart in WPF. To follow along, you will need Visual Studio and the SciChart WPF SDK installed on your machine. You can download the SDK from [https://www.scichart.com/downloads/](https://www.scichart.com/downloads/).
 
First, create a new WPF project in Visual Studio and add a reference to SciChart.Charting.dll. Then, open the MainWindow.xaml file and add the following namespace declaration to the root element:
 `
xmlns:s="http://schemas.abtsoftware.co.uk/scichart"
` 
Next, add a SciChartSurface element to the grid and give it a name:
 `

` 
Now, open the MainWindow.xaml.cs file and add the following using statements:
 `
using SciChart.Charting.Model.DataSeries;
using SciChart.Charting.Visuals.Axes;
using SciChart.Charting.Visuals.RenderableSeries;
using SciChart.Data.Model;
` 
In the constructor of the MainWindow class, add the following code to create some sample data and assign it to the chart:
 `
public MainWindow()

    InitializeComponent();

    // Create a data series
    var dataSeries = new XyDataSeries();
    dataSeries.SeriesName = "Sinewave";

    // Generate some data and append it to the data series
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    
        double x = i;
        double y = Math.Sin(i * 0.1);
        dataSeries.Append(x, y);

    // Create a numeric X axis and a numeric Y axis
    var xAxis = new NumericAxis();
    var yAxis = new NumericAxis();

    // Create a line renderable series and set its data series
    var lineSeries = new FastLineRenderableSeries();
    lineSeries.DataSeries = dataSeries;

    // Add the axes and the renderable series to the chart
    sciChart.XAxes.Add(xAxis);
    sciChart.YAxes.Add(yAxis);
    sciChart.RenderableSeries.Add(lineSeries);

    // Zoom to fit the data
    sciChart.ZoomExtents();

` 
Run the application and you should see a line chart like this:
