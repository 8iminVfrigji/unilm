ABBA Gold Greatest Hits album is not only a collection of catchy and timeless songs, but also a testament to the legacy and influence of ABBA, one of the most successful and beloved pop groups in history. ABBA was formed in 1972 by four Swedish singers and songwriters: Agnetha FÃ¤ltskog, BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The group's name is an acronym of their first names.
 
ABBA rose to fame after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974 with their song "Waterloo". They went on to produce eight studio albums and dozens of hit singles that sold over 400 million copies worldwide. Their music blended pop, rock, disco, and folk elements, and featured catchy melodies, harmonies, and lyrics. Some of their most famous songs include "SOS", "Fernando", "Chiquitita", "Voulez-Vous", "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)", and "The Name of the Game".
 
ABBA disbanded in 1982 after the marriages of both couples in the group ended. However, their music remained popular and influential over the years. They inspired many musicals, movies, tribute bands, and covers by other artists. In 1999, a musical based on their songs, Mamma Mia!, premiered in London and became a global phenomenon. In 2008 and 2018, two movie adaptations of the musical were released, starring Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Amanda Seyfried, Colin Firth, and other Hollywood stars. In 2010, ABBA was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
 
In 2018, ABBA announced that they had recorded two new songs for a virtual reality project that would feature digital avatars of themselves performing their hits. The project was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but is expected to be launched in 2023. The new songs are titled "I Still Have Faith in You" and "Don't Shut Me Down".
