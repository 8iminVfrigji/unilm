# How to Connect a Garmin Device to a Computer Using a USB to Serial DB9 Adapter
 
If you have a Garmin device that uses a NMEA 0183 output, such as a chartplotter or a sounder, you may want to connect it to your computer for data transfer or testing purposes. However, most modern computers do not have a serial port, which is what the NMEA 0183 output requires. In this case, you can use a USB to serial DB9 adapter to convert the USB port of your computer to a serial port that can communicate with your Garmin device.

A USB to serial DB9 adapter is a small device that plugs into a USB port of your computer and has a male DB9 connector on the other end. You can then connect the NMEA 0183 wires from your Garmin device to the appropriate pins on the DB9 connector. The adapter also has LED indicators for power and data transmission, and some models offer ESD protection and configurable COM ports.
 
There are many brands and models of USB to serial DB9 adapters on the market, but not all of them are compatible with Garmin devices. Some adapters may have different pin assignments, voltage levels, or drivers that may cause compatibility issues. Therefore, it is important to choose an adapter that has been tested and verified to work with Garmin devices.
 
One example of a Garmin compatible USB to serial DB9 adapter is the Coolgear USBG-232[^2^], which uses an FTDI chipset and supports Windows 11. This adapter has a 12-inch cable length and can handle baud rates up to 921.6K bps. It also has 15kV ESD protection for connected devices and COM port retention feature.
 
To connect your Garmin device to your computer using the Coolgear USBG-232 adapter, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Connect the NMEA Out + wire from your Garmin device to Pin 2 of the DB9 connector.
2. Connect the NMEA In + wire from your Garmin device to Pin 3 of the DB9 connector.
3. If your Garmin device only has one NMEA In or NMEA Out wire, those wires will be positive (+).
4. Connect the NMEA Out - (if applicable), the NMEA In - (if applicable) and the Garmin device Ground to Pin 5 of the DB9 connector and to the negative side of a 12-volt power source.
5. If the Red (Positive Power) and Black (Ground) wires of your Garmin device are not connected to a 12-volt power source, this test will not work properly.
6. Connect the completed DB9 connection to the USB port of your computer.
7. Power on your Garmin device.

Once the wiring is completed, you can use a computer program such as HyperTerminal or PuTTY to verify the information being sent from your Garmin device. You need to configure the COM port settings according to your Garmin device specifications, such as baud rate, parity, data bits, and stop bits. You should then see the NMEA 0183 sentences displayed on your computer screen.
 
Using a USB to serial DB9 adapter is an easy and convenient way to connect your Garmin device to your computer. However, you need to make sure that you choose an adapter that is compatible with your Garmin device and your computer operating system. You also need to follow the correct wiring instructions and COM port settings for successful communication.
