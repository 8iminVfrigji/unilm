Purab Aur Paschim (East and West) is a 1970 Hindi film directed by and starring Manoj Kumar, along with Saira Banu, Ashok Kumar, Pran and Prem Chopra. The film is a patriotic drama that explores the contrast between Indian and Western values, and the impact of migration on Indian culture and identity.
 
The film begins with a prologue set during the Indian independence movement, where a freedom fighter named Om is betrayed by his neighbor Harnam, who informs the British police about his whereabouts. Om is killed, leaving behind his pregnant wife Ganga and his son Bharat. Harnam flees to England with his reward money and his own son Omkar, abandoning his wife Kaushalya and his daughter Gopi. Ganga and Kaushalya are taken in by Guruji, a priest and a friend of Om, who raises Bharat and Gopi as his grandchildren.

The story then shifts to the present day (1970), where Bharat has grown up to be a proud and idealistic young man, who loves his country and its culture. He is invited by Sharma, an old friend of his father, to study in England. Sharma has settled in London with his wife Rita and their two children, Preeti and Shankar. Rita and Preeti are westernized women who wear mini-skirts, smoke, drink and have no respect for Indian traditions. Shankar is a hippie who calls himself Orphan and has no sense of direction. Bharat is shocked to see the degradation of Indian values among the expatriates, and tries to change their mindset. He also falls in love with Preeti, who is initially repulsed by him, but gradually gets attracted to his sincerity and patriotism.
 
The film depicts Bharat's struggle to uphold his culture and identity in a foreign land, while facing opposition from Rita, Harnam and Omkar, who have become rich and powerful by compromising their morals. He also faces challenges from Preeti's ex-boyfriend Mike, who tries to sabotage their relationship. Bharat eventually convinces Preeti to visit India with him, where she is transformed by the beauty and purity of the country. She gives up her bad habits and adopts a traditional lifestyle. She also meets Ganga, Kaushalya, Gopi and Guruji, who welcome her as their daughter-in-law.
 
The film ends with a happy reunion of Bharat and Preeti, who get married in India with Guruji's blessings. They also reconcile with Sharma, who realizes his mistake and apologizes for neglecting his roots. The film ends with a message of unity and harmony between East and West.
