## How to Use Style Builder 2.021000?
 
To use Style Builder 2.021000, you need to follow these basic steps:
 
1. Draw strokes for your style library. You can either scan or photograph strokes that you've drawn on paper, or use an image-editing program to draw strokes digitally[^1^]. You can also use the built-in drawing tools in Style Builder 2.021000 to draw strokes directly on the screen[^3^]. You need to draw at least 12 strokes for each edge type: straight edges, curved edges, endpoints, extensions, intersections, profiles, depth cueing, and section cuts[^1^].
2. Import your strokes into Style Builder 2.021000. You can either drag and drop your image files into the Stroke Library area, or use the File menu to browse for them[^1^]. You can then assign each stroke to its corresponding edge type by dragging it into the appropriate slot[^1^]. You can also delete, rotate, or resize your strokes as needed[^1^].
3. Preview your style in the Style Preview area. You can use the sample model provided by Style Builder 2.021000, or import your own SketchUp model to see how your style looks on it[^1^]. You can also rotate, zoom, or pan the model as you wish[^1^].
4. Adjust your style settings in the Style Settings area. You can tweak various parameters of your style, such as stroke width, color, opacity, jitter, frequency, angle bias, and more[^1^]. You can also save your style as a .style file that you can use in SketchUp later[^1^].

## What Can You Achieve with Style Builder 2.021000?
 
Style Builder 2.021000 gives you the freedom and creativity to create your own sketchy edge style that suits your personal taste and project needs. You can make your style as realistic or as abstract as you want, depending on the type of strokes you use and the settings you apply.
 
For example, you can create a style that mimics a pencil sketch by using thin and light strokes with some jitter and angle bias[^3^]. Or you can create a style that resembles a watercolor painting by using thick and colorful strokes with some opacity and frequency variation[^3^]. Or you can create a style that looks like a comic book by using bold and black strokes with some depth cueing and section cuts[^3^]. The possibilities are endless!
 
By using Style Builder 2.021000, you can add some flair and personality to your SketchUp models and make them stand out from the crowd. You can also impress your clients and colleagues with your unique and artistic presentations and designs.
