In this article, we will show you how to use Adobe Universal Patcher to crack Adobe CS and CC products on Windows. If you are a Mac user, you can use XFORCE keygen instead.
 
## Step 1: Download and install the Adobe product you want to crack
 
First, you need to download and install the trial version of the Adobe product you want to crack from the official website. You can choose from a variety of products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and more. Make sure you select the correct version (32-bit or 64-bit) according to your system.
 
When installing, choose "Try" in the first screen and then "Sign In" in the next window. It will show an error message, but you can ignore it and click "Sign In Later". Accept the license terms and complete the installation.
 
## Step 2: Download and run Adobe Universal Patcher
 
Next, you need to download and run Adobe Universal Patcher from one of these links[^1^] [^2^]. It is a small executable file that does not require installation. Before running it, make sure you turn off your internet connection and antivirus software.
 
When you run Adobe Universal Patcher, you will see a drop-down list of supported Adobe products. Select the one that matches your installed application. If your product is not listed, scroll down to the bottom and select "Try to patch another product with the amtlib file".
