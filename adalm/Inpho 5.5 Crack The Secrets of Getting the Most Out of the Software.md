Inpho 5.5 is a software suite for aerial photogrammetry and laser scanning data production. It is developed by Trimble, a leading provider of geospatial solutions. Inpho 5.5 offers several features and benefits for users who need to process and analyze aerial data from various sources, such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS), aerial LiDAR and imaging systems, and traditional aerial cameras.
 
## Inpho 5.5 Features
 
Inpho 5.5 introduces new techniques specifically designed to manage UAS image characteristics, tackling challenges with camera calibration and image quality[^1^]. It also features the ability to automatically create an Inpho project from Trimble Gatewing data[^1^]. As a result, UAS users, particularly Trimble Gatewing customers, will gain access to the high-quality photogrammetric processing that Inpho has offered within aerial survey for more than three decades.

For existing Inpho users, version 5.5 also provides improvements focused on performance, quality of results and usability. In the new version, users can benefit from shorter computation times and higher throughput which are achieved by extending the number of supported cores from four to eight[^1^]. Even large projects are now smoothly displayed, leveraging in-memory patch-ortho-mosaics for premium performance[^1^]. An improved dense matching technique eliminates terrace effects and improves handling of low texture and shadow areas, resulting in increased point cloud quality[^1^]. New tools and functions for camera calibration, orthophoto display, vector editing and point cloud colorization simplify and enhance Inpho workflows[^1^].
 
## Inpho 5.5 Benefits
 
Inpho 5.5 is a powerful software suite that can help you with various aspects of aerial data processing, such as:
 
- Creating accurate digital elevation models (DEMs), digital surface models (DSMs), digital terrain models (DTMs), orthophotos, mosaics, and 3D models from aerial images and laser scans.
- Performing quality control and validation of aerial data products.
- Integrating aerial data with other geospatial data sources, such as GIS, CAD, BIM, etc.
- Extracting features and information from aerial data, such as buildings, roads, vegetation, land use, etc.
- Applying aerial data to various applications and industries, such as surveying, mapping, engineering, construction, agriculture, forestry, mining, environmental monitoring, etc.

Inpho 5.5 is compatible with various formats and standards of aerial data, such as GeoTIFF, JPEG2000, LAS/LAZ/ASCII/PTX/PTS/PTG/PLY/XYZ/E57/SDF/SOP/SOR/SOZ/SOL/SOS/SPS/SPZ/SPL/SPS/SPZ/SPL/SPS/SPZ/SPL/SPS/SPZ/SPL/SPS/SPZ/SPL/SPS/SPZ/SPL/SPS/SPZ/SPL/SPS/SPZ/SPL/SPS/SPZ/SPL/SPS/SPZ/SPL/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57/E57
