# What's New in Autodesk Revit 2019.2 with Add-ons?
 
Autodesk Revit 2019.2 is the latest version of the popular BIM software that offers new features and enhancements to improve your design and modeling workflow. In this article, we will highlight some of the new features and add-ons that you can use to create more efficient and accurate models.
 
## Cloud Models for Revit
 
One of the most exciting new features in Revit 2019.2 is the ability to store and access non-workshared models in the cloud using BIM 360. This means that you can easily save and open your individual models in a secure and consistent way on the BIM 360 platform, without having to use worksharing. This is useful for cases where you don't need to collaborate with other team members on a model, or for personal storage of your data. You can also use cloud models for Revit to share your models with others using links or invitations.

## BIM 360 Design Collaboration
 
If you are working on a collaborative project using BIM 360 Design, you can now use the new Design Collaboration module to manage and track your design data across teams and disciplines. Design Collaboration allows you to create packages of your cloud models and share them with other teams for review and consumption. You can also view and compare different versions of your models and see how they impact the overall project. Design Collaboration also integrates with BIM 360 Document Management, so you can access all your project files in one place.
